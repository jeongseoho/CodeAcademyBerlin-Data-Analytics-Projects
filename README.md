# Data Analytics Projects - Code Academy Berlin (2023-09 Batch)

This repository contains the main projects completed while studying Data Analytics at Code Academy Berlin, starting from the 2023-09 batch. The entire course is divided into 3 main modules, each with multiple sprints and projects.

## Purpose

This repository serves as an archive of my submitted projects at Code Academy Berlin, showcasing the work I have done and the skills I have developed throughout the course.

## 1. Introduction to Data Analytics

- Visualizations, Python and Statistics core concepts

## 2. BlueBerry Winery Project

- The project involves building a Wine Quality Analytics System for BlueBerry Winery using Python, statistics, and machine learning. 
- Preparing and analyzing data to determine wine quality and aid business decisions, focusing on aspects like chemical composition and its impact on quality, while addressing data issues such as null values and outliers.

## 3. Capital Bike Share Project

- The project focuses on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, time series, and linear regression using a dataset from Capital Bike Share.
- Analyzing the data, creating models to forecast bike demand, and ultimately helping improve Capital Bike Share's services, despite the dataset requiring additional cleaning and resource checks.

## 4. SQL exercise (10 days of challenge)

- The project focuses on learning SQL, an essential skill for data analyst roles.
- SQL is used to manage data in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), where data is organized in tables consisting of columns (fields) and rows (records). 

## 5. E-Commerce Project

- Learning objectives include mastering Intermediate and Advanced SQL, using Tableau for visualizations, and learning clustering techniques in Machine Learning.
- Led an e-commerce project focusing on the European market, where I conducted comprehensive customer data analysis and clustering to derive actionable business insights.

## 6. Forecasting Asset Prices and Investment Strategies (Graduation project)
 
- Predicted the prices of investment assets one year ahead with ML and use this information to construct an investment strategy
- Python, Data Mining, Machine Learning(SARIMAX, Prophet, etc), Data Visualization
